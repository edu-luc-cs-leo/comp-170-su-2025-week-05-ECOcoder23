                                                    Midterm Review

    When considering the first five assignments I have submitted for the course of Comp 170, there have been drastic
improvements in assignment quality. One example of said improvements can be seen as more consistent formating of functions. Earlier assignment had functions that were defined inconsistently, many times they failed to specify the object class of the
input parameter(s) or the output(s). They also, at times, included "magic values" or values not tied to specific variables, which consequently made my code less legible and more difficult to modify. As of my most recent sumbitions, these inconsistencies have been all but eliminated (for the most part). Another noticeable improvement in my work can be seen in the accuracy of my code executions. In past sumbitions, in the beginning weeks of the class, my code often had outputs that were inaccurate when compared to the expected outputs for the task. This was often due to errors in my code writting such as incorrect syntax or improper organization of function components. But it is in this area in which I have seen the most improvement as my coding has matured to a point where it almost always gives the proper output required by the specified task, and even has started to more closely resemble the code of more mature coders such as my professor (Mr. Leo Irakliotis). 

    When it comes to class engagement, although there is certainly room for improvement, great strives have been made to show my 
intense dedication to the class. Despite the busyness in my life, which also exists in the lives of all other Comp 170 attendees and the life of Mr. Irakliotis no doubt, I have managed to dedicate many hours outside of class to increasing my knowledgeability and proficiency in the language of Python. I've accomplished this goal by keeping up with the assigned textbook readings, often refering back to the text while working on assignments to assure that I am properly applying the information acquired from my reading sessions. The time I dedicate to this class outside of lectures is also spent of reviewing the archived code created by Mr. Irakliotis which demonstrates the concepts we discuss during our regular weekly lectures. Reviewing this code has not only enriched my comprehension of the material by demonstrating the coding concepts in functional Python code, but it has also served the purpose of revealing standard coding conventions which I have strived to replicate in my code in order to more colsely adhere to that standard. All efforts made towards gaining a better understanding of Python would quickly be undermined by poor attendance, which is why I have also had a near perfect attendance in the course thus far, and always arrive on time to synchronus online lectures, with very few exceptions. I believe the results speak for themselves, the increased quality and proficiency with which I code is owed to the dedication that I have demonstrated as a Comp 170 student.
